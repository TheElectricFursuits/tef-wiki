This page is dedicated to list the various soldering irons that the community has tried and tested out, with the purpose of letting new community members
pick a good, known soldering iron, rather than wading through the sometimes complex or hard-to-parse online world of AliExpress.

## USB-C Irons

This category is for any small, handheld soldering iron that is powered via a USB-C port, with no internal battery. Some results are based on [this excellent Reddit teardown](https://www.reddit.com/r/soldering/comments/1c4tmpv/jbc_style_usb_soldering_iron_roundup/)

### FNIRSI HS-02A/B

The FNIRSI HS-02 is a USB-C soldering iron that can reach up to 100W with a compatible USB-C PD source or has a DC barrel adapter for up to 24V direct input (no PD). The **A** variant takes JBC C245-Style tips, which are among the most common format, and offer a large variety of tip styles, many of which can be quite useful for fursuit work (such as knockoff threaded-insert-helper tips, blade tips for cutting or welding plastic, etc.). The **B** variant takes the smaller C210 micro cartrdiges. These are shorter, heat up quicker, but there are fewer options for the exact tip type.
