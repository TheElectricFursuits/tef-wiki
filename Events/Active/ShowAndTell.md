The Show And Tell (S&T) is a somewhat-regular event, happening approximately every 2-3 months.
It is a community event of the ElectricFursuit's Telegram group, with the purpose of letting community members present their ideas, achievements and ideas in a relatively free-form presentation, followed by a Q&A session and further talks.
